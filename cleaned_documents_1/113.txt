**CLEANED TEXT**

After completing the enrollment application and paying the tuition fees, you may find on [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/) additional guidelines for validating your digital identity, activating your career, and retrieving your badge.

**Validation of Digital Identity**

### What does it mean?

Validating your digital identity means linking your account name.cognome@studio.unibo.it to what you declared during enrollment.

### What do I need to do?

Your digital identity will be automatically validated without you having to do anything, in one of the following cases:

*   You have SPID credentials and access to Studenti Online at least once;
*   You have a digital identity card and access to Studenti Online through the "Enter with CIE" path;
*   You have a foreign degree and access to Studenti Online through the "Enter with CIE" path.

**If you do not meet the above conditions** and cannot have SPID credentials, because you are a minor or reside abroad, contact the Student Office of your course of study or, if you reside abroad and have a foreign degree, the International Student Office of Bologna or your Campus.

**Activation of Career and Badge**

### What does it mean?

Activating your career serves to use services, such as Wi-Fi access and online library resources, and perform specific actions: exam registration, course planning, course transfer, or degree completion.  
After activation, you will receive an email with instructions to obtain your badge.

**The career must be activated by February 28, 2025.**

Your career will be automatically activated without you having to do anything, and you will receive an email with instructions to obtain your badge, **unless you meet one of the following profiles:**
