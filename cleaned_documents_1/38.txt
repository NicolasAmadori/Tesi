What I need to know
-------------------

The new Rules for the Use of the University Trademark allow you to place the trademark on the cover and title page of your final examination. Any other use not covered by the above is prohibited.

How I can use the University trademark
--------------------------------------

If you wish to use the University trademark, you will have to follow the graphic design rules envisaged by the Identity System, using the cover and title page templates attached.

These models indicate

If the cover is dark, you can exceptionally use the trademark in gold or silver.
