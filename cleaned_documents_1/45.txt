According to the guidelines that the Degree Programme established concerning the organisation of the exam calendar:

*   students won't have exams of the same year during the same day, whenever possible
*   Exams won't take place during the lessons period, in order to allow all students to attend them
*   Professors will organise the exam calendar with sufficient notice. They will check room availabilites before fixing the dates by getting in touch with the Teaching Services office;
*   Professors will fix at least two exam dates during the exam period that occurs just after the end of the classes for their teaching unit. They will fix at least one exam date for all the other exam periods.
