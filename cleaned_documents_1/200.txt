The Degree Programme Tutor is a useful reference point to help students in their relations with lecturers and, more in general, in the organisation of their study activities. Duties The tutor plays an important role linking students and degree programmes. She is a valuable source of information, for example, to learn about how to access the programme and carry out its activities. Students can contact the tutor also to flag requests concerning logistics or organisation. Additionally, the tutor offers personalised support to students who struggle, whether for work or other personal reasons, to keep up with the programme and exam schedules.
