### Intelligent Embedded Systems – EIT Digital Master School track

This version of the curriculum in Intelligent Embedded Systems is part of the EIT Digital Master School. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is an independent EU body created to increase Europe’s ability to innovate by nurturing entrepreneurial talents. The EIT Digital is the branch of the EIT focusing on Digital innovation.

The program offers a two-year education, the first at the University of Bologna, the second in a University of choice in Budapest, Stockholm, Tallin or Turku.

The curriculum is technically focused on Intelligent Embedded System, but also includes a minor of 30 CFUs covering topics in digital innovation and entrepreneurship.

The first year at the University of Bologna aims at offering a full understanding of the most recent trends in software engineering for embedded systems, including example of applications. The second year may be chosen to be more software or hardware-oriented and offers a specialisation and a graduation project. The graduation project includes an internship at a company or a research institute and results in a Master thesis with a strong innovation and entrepreneurship dimension.

Part of the curriculum is the EIT Digital Summer School, a two-week programme held at several locations in Europe, in relation to five areas with major societal and industrial challenges and business opportunities: Digital Cities, Digital Industry, Digital Wellbeing, Digital Tech, and Digital Finance.

The EIT Digital Master School enables the students to engage with academic, research and industrial partners across Europe. As a student, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with the EIT industrial partners and bring innovation to the market as part of your Innovation and Entrepreneurship studies.

1st (entry) year at the University of Bologna (Cesena and Forlì Campus): common courses;
