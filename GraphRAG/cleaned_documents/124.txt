    Programme aims
    In conformity with the ministerial decree on degree class objectives, the teaching programme aims to give graduates both a sound theoretical, technological and methodological grounding, and some precise operative skills acquired through working on set projects, whether group-based or individual, that form an integral partof the training.
    Specific expertise in this area is completed by a sound grounding in physics and mathematics, and interdisciplinary know-how concerning other core subject areas.
    The programme is completedby bringing the level of English up to B2. This may involve both practice in the four language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking) and compulsory attendance of lessons.
    All in all, the degree programme covers the theoretical and practical skills involved in the mainareas of computer science.
