Each object should have the keys: head, head_type, relation, tail, and tail_type. The head key must contain the text of the extracted entity with one of the types from the provided list in the user prompt. Attempt to extract as many entities and relations as you can. Maintain Entity Consistency: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency. If an entity, such as John Doe, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., Joe, he), always use the most complete identifier for that entity. The knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n[\n  {", "head", "University of Bologna", "head_type", "Organization", "relation", "located_in", "tail", "Cesena Campus", "tail_type", "Location"], {"head": "ER.GO", "head_type": "Organization", "relation": "grants", "tail": "study grants", "tail_type": "Concept"}, {"head": "AlmaCert", "head_type": "Organization", "relation": "grants", "tail": "international language certificates", "tail_type": "Concept"}, {"head": "Unibo", "head_type": "Organization", "relation": "scholarships", "tail": "Refugees", "tail_type": "Concept"}, {"head": "Peer mentor", "head_type": "Role", "relation": "supports", "tail": "students with Disabilities and SLD", "tail_type": "Concept"}, {"head": "Facebook", "head_type": "Platform", "relation": "fraudulent_messages", "tail": "fraudulent messages", "tail_type": "Concept"}, {"head": "University of Bologna", "head_type": "Organization", "relation": "located_in", "tail": "Bologna", "tail_type": "Location"}]
