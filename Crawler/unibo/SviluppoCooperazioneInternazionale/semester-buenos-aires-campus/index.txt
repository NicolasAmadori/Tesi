### **IMPORTANT: please note that it is necessary to obtain a study visa to go to Argentina.**

### **Also, you can look at this [link](https://study.buenosaires.gob.ar/es) for further information and visit the Argentinian Consulate [website](https://cmila.cancilleria.gob.ar/es/node/733).**

The courses taught abroad are totally comparable with the home study plan for the third year of Clabe. Alternatively, courses will be considered as electives for students attending other comparable study plans from other schools at Unibo.

The Learning Agreement (LA) is the document that present the correspondence of subjects the student is going to obtain.

The document is drawn up like a mirror: on the first side there is the set of subjects the student is going to attend in BA, on the other side the subjects of the study plan that should be substituted by the former ones. **The correspondence should be as indicated in the attachments called LA examples.**

In case the BA subject has more CFU than the Italian relative subject, you can get the difference of CFU and spend those CFU in electives chosen in the Italian study plan. See the file "Learning Agreement Example" in the attachments here on the right.

Once the LA has been presented, the offices of the University will validate it or, in case it is not correct, will suggest how it has to be done.

The LA is the core document of the exchange, it allows the recognition of the exams you took in BA.
