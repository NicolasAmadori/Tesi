Information on how to prepare and present a study plan.

The study plan is composed of all the exams that students have to pass in order to graduate. Some are compulsory activities, while others can be chosen and are electives.

Students can take exams only for teaching activities that have already been included in their study plan.

### When can I submit / modify my study plan?

You can sumbit/change your study plan in two periods during the academic year. For the academic year 2023/24 the periods will be:

First period: from the 7th of October to the 10th of November 2024

Students can modify their study plan **only** in these periods.
