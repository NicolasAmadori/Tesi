    You can pay your fees via the PagoPA system; to monitor the status of your payments, please refer to the 'Fee Situation - Enrolment' section on [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/welcome.htm?siteLanguage=en). After 15 November 2024 you will be informed of the amounts of the second and third instalments, if due.
    
    The payment will be valid from the moment you view it on your profile (this may take up to 2 days).
    
    You have to keep up to date with the amounts and deadlines because **the University of Bologna does not send notices**.
