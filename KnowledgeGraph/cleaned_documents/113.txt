**CLEANED TEXT**

After completing the enrollment application and paying the tuition fees, you may find on [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/) additional guidelines for validating your digital identity, activating your career, and retrieving your badge.

**Validation of Digital Identity**

### What does it mean?

Validating your digital identity means linking your account name.cognome@studio.unibo.it to what you declared during enrollment.

### What do I need to do?

Your digital identity will be automatically validated, without you having to do anything, in one of the following cases:

*   You have SPID credentials and access to Studenti Online at least once;
*   You have an electronic identity card and access to Studenti Online through the "Enter with CIE" path;
*   You have already been part of the University of Bologna's student community, from 2004 onwards;
*   You have taken a written or oral exam, even remotely, at the University of Bologna (excluding TOLC and selection exams for national competitions).

**If you don't meet the above conditions** and you can't have SPID credentials because you're a minor or reside abroad, contact the Student Office of your course of study or, if you reside abroad and have a foreign degree, the International Student Office of Bologna or your Campus.

**Activating Your Career and Badge**

### What does it mean?

Activating your career serves to use services, such as Wi-Fi access and online library resources, and perform specific actions: exam registration, course planning, course transfer, or degree completion.  
After activation, you will receive an email with instructions to obtain your badge.

**Your career must be activated by February 28, 2025.**

### What do I need to do?

Your career will be automatically activated, without you having to do anything, and you will receive an email with instructions to obtain your badge, **unless you meet one of the following profiles:**

*   **You have a foreign degree and reside abroad:** send an email to the Student Office of your course of study or the International Student Office of Bologna or your Campus with a copy of your residence permit that allows you to stay in Italy;
*   **You have a foreign degree and are a minor:** send an email to the Student Office of your course of study or the International Student Office of Bologna or your Campus with a copy of your residence permit that allows you to stay in Italy;
*   **You have a foreign degree and are an adult:** send an email to the Student Office of your course of study or the International Student Office of Bologna or your Campus with a copy of your residence permit that allows you to stay in Italy;
*   **You have not yet graduated:** after graduation, connect to Studenti Online and complete the information on your vote. Remember that the title must be obtained by December 30, 2024, otherwise, enrollment will be cancelled.

**Minors, Exemptions for Disability, and Recognition of Previous Careers**

*   **If you are still a minor** at the time of enrollment, compile the consent form that you will find in the attachments and send it, completed and signed by your parents, to the email address of the Student Office of your course of study.
*   **If you have a disability certificate** equal to or greater than 66% or a certificate under the law 104/92, to have an exemption from taxes, you must transmit the disability certificate to the email address of the Student Office of your course of study.
*   **If you want to request recognition of previous careers** concluded, after enrollment and by November 28, 2024, you must follow the guidelines published on the portal in the page [Career Abbreviation](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/iscrizioni-trasferimenti-e-laurea/abbreviazione-di-carriera).
