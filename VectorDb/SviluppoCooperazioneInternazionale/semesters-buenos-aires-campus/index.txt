**HOW TO PRESENT THE LEARNING AGREEMENT**

The Learning Agreement (LA) is the document that present the correspondence of subjects the student is going to obtain. The document is drawn up like a mirror: on the first side there is the set of subjects the student is going to attend in BA, on the other side the subjects of the study plan that should be substituted by the former ones. The correspondence should be like:

First group of correspondence:

Corporate Finance BA, 9CFU --------------------- Corporate Finance, 9CFU

In case the BA subject has more CFU than the Italian relative subject, you can get the difference of CFU and spend those CFU in electives chosen in the Italian study plan. See the file "Learning Agreement Example" in the attachments here on the right.

The sum of the CFU in the first side should differ no more than 3CFU by the sum of the CFU in the second side.

Once the LA has been presented, the offices of the University will validate it or, in case it is not correct, will suggest how it has to be done.

The LA is the core document of the exchange, it allows the recognition of the exams you took in BA.
